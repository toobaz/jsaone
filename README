====== What is jsaone? ======

This is a tiny wrapper around the json module in the Python standard library, allowing to read a json file incrementally.

This can be useful for
  * parsing json streams without waiting for the end of the transmission,
  * parsing very big json objects without wasting RAM for the json representation itself.

It is an alternative to [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ijson/|ijson]] (written when I did not know ijson existed, but in the end more efficient).

=== Efficiency ===

No extensive tests were made (if you make them, let me know), but here are the
results (in seconds) obtained in opening a local file with 384650 objects,
totalling 174 MB:

^ Parser  ^  Iteration 1 ^ Iteration 2 ^
| standard (non-incremental) json |   9.511     |   9.273     |
| cythonized jsaone               |  19.055     |  18.956     |
| ijson (with yajl2 backend)      |  62.250     |  64.538     |
| pure python jsaone              |  421.641     |  421.821     |


Those results were obtained with the script "**tests/json_load_test.py**".

Clearly those numbers are affected by the speed of the CPU and of the medium/stream.
In general the faster the CPU (compared to the storage medium/stream), the
faster will be the standard json compared to incremental ones (including
jsaone).

=== Why "jsaone" ===

Because it sounds similar to "json"... but the Sa√¥ne is a (large) stream.

=== Dependencies ===


  * [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/|simplejson]] (Python 2.5 only)
  * for speedup: [[http://cython.org|cython]] (at build time)

=== Installing ===

  - If you use Debian or a derivative (such as Ubuntu or Mint), you can simply use the packages provided above.
  - **jsaone** is on pypi, so you can install it with //pip install jsaone//
  - you can extract/clone the git repo, then move in the "jsaone" folder and give the command

  python setup.py build_ext --inplace


=== Usage ===


  import jsaone
  with open('/path/to/my/file.json') as f:
      gen = jsaone.load(f)
      for i in gen:
          ...

=== Development ===

You can browse the git repo [[http://www.pietrobattiston.it/gitweb?p=jsaone.git|here]] or clone with
  git clone git://pietrobattiston.it/jsaone
