"""
This is a simple incremental json parser. It relies on other parsers for the
real operation: all it does is to read the "key : value" pairs one at a time
and call the parser separately on each of them. It may hence be slower than the
original parser, but it allows to process json strings which represent a very
large number of objects (compared to the available RAM), or to parse json
streams without waiting for the end of their transmission.
